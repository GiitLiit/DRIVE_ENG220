 Abstract: 
One of the major issues regarding access to healthcare is the availability of hospitals and their accessibility by proximity. A major issue primarily faced in rural areas is the lack of proximity to a hospital. Especially in New Mexico, where we have a lot of rural areas and tribal land that are an average of 1-3 hours away from hospitals. Additionally, we have only one trauma 1 hospital in New Mexico, which is UNM Hospital. Overall, this is an issue that plagues many rural areas in the United States. There is an extreme need for government help and aid to support the building of more hospitals and access to healthcare. There is also a need for cheap and quick ways to sustain life while patients are being transported to UNM Hospital or an emergency room close by. Not only is there a lack of hospitals and cheap healthcare, but there are also short-staffed areas. One of the solutions that we feel can counteract these issues is a combination of more telehealth and mobile health clinics. We should have doctors on call for video healthcare, along with mobile health clinics being put in many different rural areas with access to insulin, antibiotics, and in-field medical training. 

Possible Solutions: 
Telehealth expansion, AI doctors, mobile health clinics, free health care, and more affordable medical school.

	Contribution: I will be creating a basic script of what we will discuss in our video. It will not be a word for word script but more of a list of bullet points that highlights our key ideas and will let each person elaborate on all of our main ideas. I will also be in charge of the flow of our video, deciding what topics will make most sense discussing when and where. This will be important in making our video clean and clear.
